    "# Protocol 2: Verification of Photodiode Performance Activated by Arduino\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol aims to verify the accuracy and temporal stability of a photodiode when illuminated by an LED controlled by an Arduino board.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardware:**\n",
    "* 1 × Arduino (Nano, Uno or equivalent)  \n",
    "* 1 × White LED  \n",
    "* 1 × 220 Ω resistor (in series with the LED)  \n",
    "* 1 × Photodiode + its power/reading circuit  \n",
    "* 1 × Breadboard and Dupont wires  \n",
    "* 1 × Computer with **Arduino IDE** to flash the code  \n",
    "* 1 × Computer with **Python 3** and required libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Required scripts:**\n",
    "* `arduino_trigger_master.ino` (Arduino sketch used here to toggle the pin HIGH/LOW and control the LED)  \n",
    "* `arduino_led_control.py` (optional, for serial control)  \n",
    "* `analyze_and_plot_photodiode_wav.py` (Python script to analyze photodiode measurements)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Hardware Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect a **LED** and a **220 Ω resistor** in series between the **Arduino pin 8** and **GND**.  \n",
    "2. Place the **photodiode** facing the LED, at a distance of about **5 cm**.  \n",
    "3. Verify proper power supply and signal reading of the photodiode.  \n",
    "4. Prepare two testing environments:  \n",
    "   * **Near-darkness** (dark room)  \n",
    "   * **Real-world conditions** (room lights on)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Arduino Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flash on the Arduino a code that repeatedly toggles the **output pin** (where the LED is connected) from **HIGH** to **LOW**.  \n",
    "2. In our case, we use the sketch `arduino_trigger_master.ino`, initially designed to generate triggers in other experiments.  \n",
    "3. This code is not specifically optimized for this manipulation as it contains other functions, but it works well enough to precisely switch the LED on and off.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Arduino code (.ino) for automatic periodic trigger generation using TimerOne.**  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```cpp\n",
    "> #include <TimerOne.h>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> const int triggerPin = 8;       // TTL output on pin 8\n",
    "> const unsigned long period_us = 500000;   // Period = 500 ms\n",
    "> const unsigned long pulse_width_us = 1000; // Pulse width = 1 ms\n",
    ">\n",
    "> void setup() {\n",
    ">   pinMode(triggerPin, OUTPUT);\n",
    ">   digitalWrite(triggerPin, LOW);\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   Timer1.initialize(period_us);         // Timer triggered every 500 ms\n",
    ">   Timer1.attachInterrupt(trigger);      // Function called at each tick\n",
    "> }\n",
    ">\n",
    "> void loop() {\n",
    ">   // Timer handles everything\n",
    "> }\n",
    ">\n",
    "> void trigger() {\n",
    ">   digitalWrite(triggerPin, HIGH);\n",
    ">   delayMicroseconds(pulse_width_us);    // 1 ms pulse\n",
    ">   digitalWrite(triggerPin, LOW);\n",
    "> }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Signal Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Condition 1: dark room, arm still**  \n",
    "   Run the Arduino sequence and record the photodiode output.  \n",
    "2. **Condition 2: dark room, arm moving slightly**  \n",
    "   Repeat the recording and observe the effect of movement.  \n",
    "3. **Condition 3: ambient light, arm still**  \n",
    "   Repeat the recording with room lights on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Save files with clear naming, for example:  \n",
    "* `dark_immobile.wav`  \n",
    "* `dark_move.wav`  \n",
    "* `light_immobile.wav`  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Signal Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the Python script `analyze_and_draw_photodiode_wav.py` to:  \n",
    "   * Detect light peaks  \n",
    "   * Compute ON/OFF intervals  \n",
    "   * Generate histograms and plots of the signal  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Condition Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare measured intervals with the expected value (e.g., **250 ms period, 100 ms ON**).  \n",
    "Evaluate:  \n",
    "* **Mean interval**  \n",
    "* **Min / Max values**  \n",
    "* **Standard deviation (jitter)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results obtained under lit conditions vs. dark room (with and without movement):  \n",
    "> ![Scope settings](../pictures/arduino_trigger_master_timer_led_light_on.png)  \n",
    "> ![Scope settings](../pictures/arduino_trigger_master_timer_led_move.png)  \n",
    "> ![Scope settings](../pictures/arduino_trigger_master_timer_led_no_move.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check whether ambient light introduces **noise** and reduces detection accuracy.  \n",
    "* Assess the influence of arm movement on **temporal stability**.  \n",
    "* Note that results may vary by a few milliseconds depending on experimental conditions.  \n",
