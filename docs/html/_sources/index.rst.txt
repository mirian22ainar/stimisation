**🧠 MEG Stimulus–Response Synchronization Project**

Welcome to this website dedicated to my final-year internship work at the NeuroSpin center (CEA Saclay), focused on improving the synchronization system used in magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiments. (In other words I'm working on optimizing the stimulation process in MEG experiments — which inspired the name *Stimisation*)

**👩🏽 About Me**

My name is Mirian. I'm a final-year engineering student at CentraleSupélec and ESME, specializing in medical robotics and biomedical technologies. This project is part of my internship within the MEG team at NeuroSpin.
This online resource is for documenting work in progress and discussion.
The main goal of this work is to propose a **portable and modern alternative** to the current trigger generation and response capture system used in MEG experiments. The existing setup relies heavily on **parallel ports** or proprietary hardware. 

  
Main goals:
  
1. **Generating triggers using an Arduino microcontroller**. 
  
2. **Studying the detection of visual stimuli displayed on screen using a photodiode**. 
  
3. **Combining both approaches into a unified and functional system**.

4. **Clearly documenting the signal circuits involved in MEG experiments to assist future users**.
